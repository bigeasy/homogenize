### Accumulate Visited Versions

This is actually done by
[Skip 0.0.2](https://github.com/bigeasy/skip/releases/tag/v0.0.2). We've
upgraded to Skip 0.0.2 and we test that we don't get in the way of visited
version accumulation.

### 100% Test Coverage

We now test the following conditions.

 * Versions not included in the value versions set are ignored.

### Issue by Issue

 * Implement reverse iterators. #14.
 * Upgrade Skip to 0.0.3. #13.
 * Upgrade Skip to 0.0.2. #12.
 * Test that invalid versions are excluded. #11.
